Daveâ€™s New Kitchen (on Noyes St. in Evanston) offers ravioli with 3
fillings (ricotta, butternut squash, lobster) with a choice of 3
sauces (tomato, cream, wild mushroom).

How could you represent a ravioli filling/sauce combination as data?
In particular, consider how your representation would allow you to
define these functions:


Design a data-type to represent ravioli dishes that allows you to
represent any possible ravioli combination.

Then design the four functions described above. Follow the Design Recipe.
